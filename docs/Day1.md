# Day 1 : Historian Hysteria
- We have locations that are identified using a **location ID**
- We made 2 groups each making their own 
- It was found that the 2 lists are not identical
- We should compare the location IDs in order, sorted
- At the end, sum up all the distances, to get the final distance
